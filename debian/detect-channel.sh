# detect-channel.sh — detect the user's Protect release channel from
# UniFi OS's runnables.yaml and write a normalised name to
# /etc/onvif-recorder/channel.
#
# runnables.yaml lives at /data/unifi-core/config/runnables.yaml and looks
# like:
#
#   releaseChannels:
#     network: beta
#     protect: beta
#     access: release
#     ...
#
# UniFi OS values (release | release-candidate | beta) map to our apt
# suites (stable | rc | early-access). If the file is missing or
# unparseable we leave the existing /etc/onvif-recorder/channel alone
# (or default to stable on first run).
#
# We also probe the apt repo: if the preferred suite has no Release file
# published yet (happens while a release is still only in early-access),
# drop through to the next best available suite instead of writing a
# dead channel that would 404 on apt-get update.
